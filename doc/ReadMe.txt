The Paleo Packager

The PaleoPackager.exe executable can be installed anywhere
on your computer. 

Because the packager does not write into its local folder,
the packager may be installed under the usually protected
folders, like the Program Files or Program Files (x86)
folders, without the need to manage security issues.
The packager saves its configuration data in the user's
roaming AppData folder:

%APPDATA%\Paleo\Packager.ini
